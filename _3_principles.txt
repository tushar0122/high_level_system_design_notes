Separation of Concern 
    => Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a fundamental design principle that advocates for the division of a system into distinct sectionsâ€”each addressing a particular set of functionalities.

Elements of SoC
    => Single Responsibility: Modules, classes, and methods should only have one reason to change. For example, a User class should handle user data, but not also display user data.

    => Low Coupling: Components should minimize their interdependence.

    => High Cohesion: Elements within a component should pertain to the same functionality.
