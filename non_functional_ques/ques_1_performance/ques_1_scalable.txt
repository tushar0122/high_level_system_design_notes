Scalability

Scalability KPI 
    => ThroughtPut for large number of requests
    => Latency for large number of requests

What we need actually
    => Fast read 
    => Fast processing 
    => Fast write 

How can we do 
    => parallel processing
        => multithreading 
    => using main memory for fast processing
        => caching 
    => distributing load 
        => load balancing 
        => horizontal scaling 
    => Using large memory and multi processor cpu 
        => Vertical Scaling

How would you design a system to handle millions of requests per second?
How do you ensure your system is horizontally scalable?
