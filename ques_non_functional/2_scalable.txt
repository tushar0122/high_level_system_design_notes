How would you design a system to handle millions of requests per second?

1. Load Balancing
Use Global Load Balancers (GLB) (e.g., AWS Route 53, GCP Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across regions.
Deploy Layer-7 Load Balancers (e.g., Nginx, Envoy, HAProxy) to route traffic intelligently.
Implement Layer-4 Load Balancers (e.g., AWS ALB/NLB, Google Load Balancer) for TCP-level optimization.

2. Scalable API Gateway
Use API Gateways like Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway to handle authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
Integrate Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent DDoS attacks.

3. Distributed Caching
Deploy Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data, reducing load on databases.
Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to cache responses globally.

4. Asynchronous Processing
Use Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to decouple services and ensure high throughput.
Implement Event-Driven Architecture using Apache Kafka or Google Pub/Sub.
